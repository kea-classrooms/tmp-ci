# kea-dev/social-coding

**This repo is used to offer assignments (exercises) in GitHub Classroom related to the module ["Social Coding"](https://docs.kea.dev/posts/social-coding/) which - as always - you will find a [docs.kea.dev](https://docs.kea.dev)**

If you have any questions feel free to join the [discussion üí¨ @ kea-dev](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dev/discussions)

# How to get started

After you have acceptet the assignment in GitHub Classroom, you will need to initialize it by importing the issues from the template. So let's start with testing wether...


# Are you GitHub Ready?

This execise makes use og VS Code and the GitHub CLI `gh`. The very first thing you need to check is if you have the command line interface `gh` (GitHub) installed. We will be using it extensively. 

If you are working in a GitHub CodeSpace it may just work out of the box. If you are in VC Code on your PC you need to install it. 

- [ ] Test if `gh`is properly installed by running the command below:

```
gh auth status
```

üí° It should tell you that you are good to go.<br/>
‚ùå If it doesn't then you need to make sure that it's [installed correctly](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation) and that you are properly [authenticated](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login).<br/>
üí¨ If you need help call out at the [discussion @ kea-dev](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dev/discussions)

# Import issues from template repository

- [ ] Accept the assigmenet you were given in GitHub Classroom
- [ ] Open the repo in a GitHub CodeSpace (or in VS Code on your PC)
- [ ] Run the script that will copy the template issues from the template repository to your own.

- Open a terminal
- Make sure your working directory is the root of the repository
- Copy the code below an run it

```
.github/template/cpissues.sh
```

The command will create a series of issues in your own repo - simply get cracking at 'em - work those issues!

The issues are deliberatly given to you in an _un-ordered_ fashion. One of the issues stands out though: _"README FIRST"_ ...I suggest you start with that!
